# PyFlix
Based on the assignments given in my Algorithms and Data Structures I module.
This Netflix-Type movie queue implements a DLL (Doubly Linked List) abstract data type to add, remove, traverse and search for movies.
Each node in the queue points to both a previous and next node within the list and maintains a current pointer to the current movie
position within the queue. From this project I gained a lot of insight into how to maintain an efficient list in memory instead of allowing 
Python to dynamically allocate memory for list entries which may not be used. I also learned different implentations of searching and the 
most efficient methods depending on data input size.
